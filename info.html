	<p>She comes from a once peaceful planet called kintom but the residents on the planet were quickly destroying it knowingly. The planet had beautiful animals that were able to fly and swim. There were places on the planet that were so quiet that any disturbance would seem loud; it almost felt as if you were falling through a deep hole. She enjoyed going there and playing music on her musical instruments</p>
